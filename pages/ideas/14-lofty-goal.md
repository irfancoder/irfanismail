Lately I see some incredible talents and personally know one, who has achieved insane feats in the software engineering space. Take [this guy](https://github.com/gabrielpetersson) for example.

He is a high school dropout (not even college/university) turned software engineer at 18 years old, pulled off remarkable engineering feats (checkout his GitHub repo), and is now working at Midjourney 4 years later.

For the most part, it makes me happy to learn from them and improve myself, however internally, it challenged me at the same time. It's a weird feeling indeed. But, that made me question:

> Can I also achieve such feat one day?

InsyaAllah, one day.
