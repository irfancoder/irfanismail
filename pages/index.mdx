# About

Hi, I'm Irfan Ismail, a software engineer living in Seremban, Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.

Thank you for dropping by. My hope for this site is to become a documentation of interesting things I learn about anything (eg. code/finance/tech-trends). Who knows, _you_ can benefit from it too!

Also serves as my personal website-lah ðŸ˜†

I enjoy building design systems and UI libraries, and primarily work with **Javascript/Typescript** in **React**'s ecosystem.

I am currently self-employed/freelance (since July 2022) and my most recent contributions are in the open-data initiatives led by several Malaysian government ministries, which you can find out more in [Portfolio](/portfolio).

Have a blessed day & asalamualaikum
